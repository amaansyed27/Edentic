# Multi-Clip Sequencing & Audio Sync Fixes

## 🎯 **Problems Fixed**

### 1. **Audio Duration Mismatch**
**Error**: `end duration greater than audio duration for audio_id`
**Cause**: Voiceover (45s) was longer than video timeline (26.1s)
**Fix**: Audio duration now matches actual video timeline length

### 2. **Single Clip Usage** 
**Problem**: Only using first/longest clip instead of sequencing all clips
**Fix**: Enhanced timeline to sequence multiple clips in order

### 3. **Missing Title Card**
**Problem**: Generated title image not being added to timeline
**Fix**: Title card now added at beginning of video

## 🔧 **Enhanced Features**

### **Multi-Clip Sequencing**
```
🖼️ Title Card (3s) 
📹 clip1.mp4 - Grinding (12s)
📹 clip2.mp4 - Pouring (15s) 
📹 clip3.mp4 - Finished Cup (15s)
🎤 Voiceover (0-45s) - matches total video length
```

### **Audio Synchronization**
- Voiceover duration = actual video timeline duration
- No more audio longer than video errors
- Proper overlay timing

### **Smart Duration Allocation**
- Title card: 3s (or 10% of total, whichever is less)
- Remaining time split evenly among video clips
- Each clip uses up to 95% of source duration
- Minimum 5s per clip, maximum 8s fallback

## 🎬 **Expected Results**

**Before**: 
```
🎬 Using main video: clip1.mp4 for 26.1s
✅ Added voiceover (0-45.0s) ❌ MISMATCH
❌ Stream generation failed: audio longer than video
```

**After**:
```
🖼️ Adding title card: 3.0s
📹 Adding clip1.mp4: 14.0s  
📹 Adding clip2.mp4: 14.0s
📹 Adding clip3.mp4: 14.0s
🎤 Syncing voiceover: 45.0s audio to match 45.0s video
✅ Added voiceover (0-45.0s) ✅ MATCHED
✅ Timeline ready: 45.0s of video content
🎬 Generating video stream...
✅ Video generated successfully!
```

## 🚀 **Your Coffee Tutorial Should Now Include**

1. **Title Card**: "Perfect Pour-Over Coffee" (3s)
2. **Grinding Scene**: clip1.mp4 showing coffee grinding (~14s)
3. **Pouring Scene**: clip2.mp4 showing water pouring (~14s)  
4. **Final Cup**: clip3.mp4 showing finished coffee (~14s)
5. **Voiceover**: Female narration explaining each step (45s total)
6. **Background Music**: Cafe-style acoustic music throughout

**Total Duration**: 45 seconds as requested
**All Clips Used**: In correct sequence (grind → pour → finish)
**Audio Synced**: Voiceover matches video length exactly

The tutorial should now be properly sequenced with all your clips and synchronized audio!
