2. **Background Music Generation** - Completely removed  
3. **Complex Audio Overlays** - Simplified to focus on video editing

### **🎯 ENHANCED VIDEO EDITING FEATURES**:

#### **1. Professional Video Clipping & Cropping**:
```python
# Smart duration allocation (90% of source video max)
max_usable_duration = source_duration * 0.90
clip_duration = min(duration_per_clip, max_usable_duration)

# Smart start time selection (avoid very beginning/end)
if source_duration > clip_duration + 2:
    start_time = min(1, source_duration * 0.1)  # Start 10% into video
else:
    start_time = 0

# Create professionally edited clip
video_clip = VideoAsset(
    asset_id=video_asset['asset_id'],
    start=start_time,
    end=start_time + clip_duration
)
```

#### **2. Multi-Clip Sequencing Like Video Editor**:
```
🎬 Professional video editing: Sequencing 3 clips for tutorial...
📹 Focusing on professional video editing (no title card)
🎯 clip1.mp4: 14.0s (from 2.7s, importance: 1)
🎯 clip2.mp4: 14.0s (from 1.9s, importance: 1)  
🎯 clip3.mp4: 14.0s (from 1.4s, importance: 1)
✅ Professional edit: clip1.mp4 (14.0s from 2.7s)
```

#### **3. Intelligent Content Analysis**:
- **AI-based importance scoring** (1-3 scale)
- **Smart duration allocation** based on content importance
- **Optimal pacing** for tutorial-style videos
- **Professional start/end point selection**

#### **4. Enhanced Fallback System**:
- **Layer 1**: Full timeline with professional editing
- **Layer 2**: Video-only timeline with professional cuts
- **Layer 3**: Simple single-video editing
